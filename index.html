<h1><u><font color="white"> Moments Where I Have Seen ICT as a Platform of Advocacy</font> </u></h1>
<h2>
<p> There are many instances in our life where ICT has played a vital role. In it we are the users, we are the ones responsible for our actions, but that is not the
only reason why ICT is important</p>
<p> Many people has something to stand for, something to hold on, and something to fight for, an advocacy or for a cause.</p>

<p> Now, I personally am not an active user of ICT, I am a bit old-school when it comes to my activities. But that doesn't stop me from surfing the net from time
to time. And when I do, different advocacies and pages comes out of the blue. </p>

<p> One such advocacy was this young girl's advocacy.</p>

<h2>
<p> <i>Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg</i> (born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish environmental activist who is internationally known for challenging world leaders to take immediate action against climate change. Thunberg initially gained notice for her youth and her straightforward speaking manner, both in public and to political leaders and assemblies, in which she criticises world leaders for their failure to take what she considers sufficient action to address the climate crisis.</p>
<p> <font color="beige"> A true warrior of Climate Change Advocacies, she created a national image as a kid advocating for climate change action. Now 
at that time, she was not really a prominent figure to the whole world. Not until this picture was posted on social media and circulated online. </p> </h2>

<figcaption><FONT COLOR="white"> Protesting in front of her School. </font> </figcaption></h5>

<h2>
<p> The sign says, "School Strike for Climate". She protested in front of her school and encouraged other students as well to join her protest.
This photo was posted online, making her popular among other activists and the whole world as well. </p>
<p> She was eventually met by favorable responses and was even invited to different Conferences to speak. She became a symbol of a movement among the rising
youth. She was eventually nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for her actions.</P>

<p> This is why I believe that even though the Social Media and ICT World has negative effects, it also has positive effects as well. </p>
<p> Through the use of social media, advocacies like Greta's became widespread and raised awareness among people in authority and world governments. It created hope among 
people who have something to fight for. With the efficiency of this digital world, many people have access to a larger number of people for them to reach out to. They finally have the audience that they want
